## Hey there, I'm Anurag! 

A full-time **Python Developer**, part-time **MERN Stack Developer {Core Backend}**, and a forever **CS Undergrad** just out here trying to make sense of this wild tech jungle.


> Here I pretend to know what I'm doing in Public :)

### What I Actually Do:

- Build bots that do some beep boop and produce results 
- Craft backends that don't crash on the first API call (usually)  
- Get into unnecessary debates about tabs vs spaces  
- Fight JS, lose gracefully  
- Lowkey flex my projects when no one's watching

### Currently cooking:
- A cooler version of myself  
- More bots, more chaos  
- Accepting the trauma that comes with JavaScript

**P.S.**: Yes, I still hate JS. But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
